clean_cakes <- read_csv(here("3_clean_data/clean_cakes.csv"))
```


1. I will find out which cake has the most cocoa in it.

```{r}
clean_cakes %>% 
  filter(ingredient == "Cocoa") %>%
  mutate(highest_cocoa_amount = max(amount)) %>%
  head(1)
```


2. I am going to find out how many cups of ingredients are used in total for sponge cakes.

```{r}
clean_cakes %>%
  filter(cake == "Sponge") %>%
  filter(measure == "cup") %>%
  summarise(cups_used = sum(amount))
```

3. I am also going to find out how many ingredients are measured in teaspoons.

```{r}
clean_cakes %>%
  filter(measure == "teaspoon") %>%
  summarise(ingredients_teaspoon = n_distinct(ingredient))
```

4. Finally, I'll check which ingredients are used only once.

```{r}
clean_cakes %>%
  group_by(ingredient) %>%
  summarise(ingred_used_once = n()) %>% 
  filter(ingred_used_once == 1)
```
